1>> TO FIND ELEMENT IN SET DATA STRCUTURE, WE NEED LOG(N) TIME COMPLEXITY AS IT IMPLEMENT BALANCED BINARY TREE!

2>> MAP DATA STRCUTURE IMPLEMENT BINARY SEARCH TREE SO FIND,DELETE AND INSERT ALWAYS TAKES LOG(N)  TIME COMPLEXITY!

3>> UNORDERED MAP DATA STRCUTURE USES HASH TABLE SO IT TAKES O(1) IN AVERAGE CASE BUT O(N) IN WORST CASE!
